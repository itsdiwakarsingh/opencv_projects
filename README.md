## 🚀 Projects

- **Hand Pose Tracking**  
  Use hand landmarks to detect gestures and control functionality, such as adjusting volume or toggling features with specific motions.

- **Face Mesh Detection**  
  Apply face landmark tracking for applications such as augmented reality effects, virtual filters, or drowsiness detection.

- **Motion-Based Controls**  
  Implement gesture-based interfaces like swipe detection (e.g., TikTok-style swipe), virtual mouse control, or on-screen drawing (virtual painter).

- **Virtual Painter**  
  Draw on the screen using hand movements — a fun and intuitive way to create without physical tools.

- **Virtual Mouse**  
  Control the mouse cursor using hand gestures — move, click, and drag without touching any hardware.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time computer vision using OpenCV  
- Lightweight and easy to run on most devices  
- Modular scripts — mix and match for custom workflows  
- Great for learning and experimenting with gesture recognition
